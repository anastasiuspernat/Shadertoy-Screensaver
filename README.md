# Shadertoy Screensaver

The goal with this project would be to load an arbitrary [shadertoy](https://shadertoy.com) shader by giving an URL and
use it as a macos screensaver. First goal is to just be able to load a single buffer shader
but more features will be added in the future.

## Development

I've heavily utilized ChatGPT while developing this app as I haven't used Objective-C much
previously.

## TODO
* One to one mapping of GL uniforms to the ones used in shadertoy
